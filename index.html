Camera Effects on HTML: 
<b>HTML, Canvas, CSS and Vanilla JS</b>

This program captures your default cam
and apply some effects on it

- To apply the effects, just click in 
the canvas
- You can see what effect is currently
applied in the console
- You can mix the effects changing the 
EFFECTS variable in console, it must be
a array of effects, like EFFECTS = 
['gray', 'invert'] (sorry i'm too lazy 
to build a nice UX/UI)
- You may find some bugs in the mixing 
effects function, i didn't spend a lot 
of time coding it
- Fun fact: it's a bit laggy because i
was affradi to code something wrong and
push my processor too much, so i fixed it
in 10fps  
- Fun fact 2: surprisingly the mirror
effect was the hardest one to do the math
